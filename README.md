# Box management system
A Data Structure Project - This Application allows you to Manage your small box storage.
The application is doing it in a very efficient way, using BST inside of a BST to contain your box information and a List to hold dates, in order to organize them by size.
The application allows you to : 
1. Show supply by the box.
2. Show all supplies available.
3. Buy supply.
4. Add supply.
5. Check supply date.
6. Remove expired supply.
